# HocusFocus

## What Does it Do?

Having this extension enabled will give focus back to the webview whenever a search is run from Safari's URL bar.  No options to configure.  No settings to change.

## Fixing My Biggest Gripe With Safari

This extension is painfully simple.  Basically, there is what I feel to be an egregious UX issue with Safari 6.  Let me walk you through it:

1. Type "bacon recipes" into the URL bar.
2. After the page loads, go to scroll through the results with your arrow keys.
3. Realize that focus is still in the search bar and your arrow keys are useless.
4. Grab your mouse and click through the page.

It's worse if you use an extension like Gleebox to run in-page searches.  You can't if you use Safari's search bar.

## Safari Hurts Me

I've noticed that the more I use my mouse, the more carpal tunnel flare ups I get.  For a while, I switched to Chrome but since that likes to lock up the UI server on my Mac, I've moved back to Safari.

## Apple Won't Fix

When this behavior first exhibited itself, I started reporting it to Apple as a pretty severe UX issue and they've closed the issue as a duplicate or explained that it is working as expected.

## No Other Browsers Have This Problem

Chrome, Firefox, Safari before version 6, etc.  All of them give focus back to the webview after you've entered something into the URL or search bar.  It's natural and it feels right.  I'm done with you URL bar, send me to the webview.

## One More Thing

Since Safari doesn't give focus back to the webview after running a search, if you're on a slow connection (3G, LTE with poor service, etc) then you'll find that the browser gives you absolutely no feedback that it's doing anything.  When the URL bar has focus, it doesn't show the loading bar.  Since the URL bar always has focus when you're doing a search, you never know that anything is happening.

This extension can't fix that issue.  As far as I know, it's not possible to fix this with an extension because of the way you activate tabs.

If anyone has an idea or a solution for that, please let me know.
